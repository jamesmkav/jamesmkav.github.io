Male or female, or even Prince. Every ounce of porn in the world has your name on it and your bank account swells every day as a result. You star in several movies until you later years, when you become a member of the cast of "The View". During this time, you have an affair with Dr. Phil and retire with him in Texas, where you start the most successful sex toy business ever concieved. He endorses the products and Oprah gives you a segment on her show. After you die, your genitals are removed and treated with resin for preservation in the Smithsonian where future generations gaze upon it and crack jokes to their friends. </p><br><br>
