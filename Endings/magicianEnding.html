Well, the only place to go now is up! So, you travel the world in search of the next big trick. Not  fake stuff. Real magic. You start in Baton Rougue and learn the ways of voodoo for several years. Then across the American Southwest in search of brujo and Native American curses. Eventually your search leads you to Tibet. Where you learn to completely detach yourself from the physical universe and maipulate physical objects in spiritual form, while outside your body. After learning and perfecting this technique, you come back to the mainstream magicain circuit, performing tricks that were impossible by standard means before. Rather than dying, you simply vanish one day. People saw you go into your study one night, but you never come out. After a few days and unresponsiveness from knocking on the door, your maid bashes the door in but you simply aren't there. But a note is found! A riddle embossed on it, provoking an intrepid young soul to seek the hidden location of your remains and the answers behind your secrets. </p><br><br>
