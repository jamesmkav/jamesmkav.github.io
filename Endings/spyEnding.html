If you had a family, they're all dead now anyway. Though you have saved the world many times over, no one can ever know that is was you or the part you played in it. It's time to retire. You find a small apartment in Paris with a balcony facing the Eiffel tower and settle in. But after a short time, you are bored beyond measure.<br><br> Finding no meaning left in your life, you slowly climb the stairs, intending to commit suicide. When you get to the top, there is already someone there about to do the same thing. Your old instincts take over and you attempt a daring rescue, grabbing their hand as they go over the edge.<br><br> "Give me your other hand!", you yell. But they slowly look you in the eye, and tell you, "Look in locker A15. Where the tracks end." Then they force your hand to let go and plummet to their death without even a whisper. Quickly you leave the scene before the police arrive and make it back to you apartment. Deducing that they meant for you to find a locker at the Paris train station, you quickly go there and locate it. Inside, you find a small note. Unfurling the paper you begin to read it.<br><br>"Good evening agent. Your mission if you choose to accept it...."</p><br><br>
