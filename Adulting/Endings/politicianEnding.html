One day, just to prove your point, you are walking down the street and you shoot someone for no reason. Your approval ratings double and you are appointed embassador to the world. Theres nothing that happens without you being there. There isn't even a rebellion. The world is 100% behind you, almost in a catatonic state. You eveentually tire of being constantly asked how to deal with situations and retire to Antarctica to get away from it all. In your absence, the world deteriorates into constant war over nothing and eventually everyone is killed through nuclear warfare, except you. For your remaining days, you get drunk off of the finest wines, eat the only food left on Earth and watch the fallout's effects on the beautiful Antarctic night sky. </p><br><br>
