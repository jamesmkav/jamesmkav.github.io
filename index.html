        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>First, decide how many turns the game will be. Each turn you recieve a salary that increases according to your level. The player that goes first is the one who has the most cash on hand. Everyone starts on the Start square and will roll 2 dice each turn to decide movement. If a player lands on a blank space, they draw a card corresponding to the zone they are in and follow it's instructions. Otherwise, the player follows the instructions on the space itself.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
        <p>At the end of the decided number of turns, all of the player's assets(Money and XP) are tallied up. The player with the highest amount of total assets wins the game. Your total money will be divided by 100K. </p><br><br>
        <h3>Basic Gameplay Rules</h3>
        <p><strong>STARTING LEVEL</strong> - All players start at Level 0 and make $20K a turn for their salaries.<br><br>
            <strong>TURN</strong> - Once a player rolls for movement, the previous player's turn is over.<br><br>
            <strong>CHEATING</strong> - Anything is legal if you don't get caught...but seriously, don't cheat. If you do, you are a piece of shit.<br><br>
            <strong>PROMOTIONS</strong> - For each promotion a player recieves through landing on spaces or drawn cards, they increase 1 Level and recieve a higher salary, as well as a special perk unique to the character class.<br><br>
            <strong>MOVEMENT</strong> - Every player uses 2 dice for movement each turn, unless specified otherwise through a perk. <br><br>
            <strong>ROLLING DOUBLES</strong> - Each time a player rolls doubles, they double their salary for that turn. This must be entered manually.<br><br>
            <strong>DEGREES</strong> - All player classes require a degree before a promotion can be achieved except the hobo character. This is achieved by graduating from the School section through passing your Final Exam.<br><br>
            <strong>FINAL EXAM</strong> - In order to graduate from school, a player must pass a Final Exam. The player to their right draws a Final Exam card. The player must answer at least 3 of the 5 questions correctly to recieve their degree and be eligible for promotions.<br><br>
            <strong>ITEM SPACES</strong> - If a player lands on an Item space, they can draw an item card. They do not have to show it to the other players and may play it on their next turn or during any turn after.<br><br>
            <strong>BLANK SPACES</strong> - If you land on a blank space, draw a Zone Card from the current zone you landed in.<br><br>
            <strong>STOP SPACES</strong> - If you land on a STOP space even when mid movement, you stay there until your next turn and follow it's instructions. If moving backwards for any reason, you still stop but do recieve the spaces effects.
