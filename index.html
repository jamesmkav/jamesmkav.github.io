<h3>About Me:</h3><p>I started professionally cooking around age 19. It was really out of necesity more than anything. i was going to college for something that I can't quite remember clearly. I think it was photograhy. The reality is, I din't know what i realy wanted to do, but there were girls in college. So I was in college.<br>In my second semester, I needed to start fulfilling some elective credits for my associate's degree. One in particular caught my eye. It was an intensive cooking course. It gave you 9 elective credits, which is huge. In one semester, I could get a third of my elective credits out of the way. I figured, if nothing else, that would be the ideal place to meet girls. They could probably cook too! Bonus points for sure.<br>I showed up for class like the typical slacker I was at the time. No tools, reeking of pot and all attitude. We had a class of roughly 15 people. A very diverse bunch. An equal number of men and women with almost everyone representing a different nationality. The class was done in two parts with kitchen work on four days a week and lectures every other day. I quicky came to realize that this class was like having a full time job. Those credits weren't going to come easy. <br>I immediately loved the work. I had never cooked anything beyond a Kraft product and the instructors opend my mind up to a whole world I had never experienced. My first day in the kitchen, they laid a box of massive beef bones on the table. They gave me a hacksaw and a massive cleaver and told me to start breaking the flinstone sized bones into smaller pieces. We were going to make stock. I lined up a smaller bone on the chopping block and wound up with the cleaver. When I smashed it down, the bone slit in two and each piece shot in the opposite direction, one leaving a dent in the steel wall beside me. I was in love.<br>After getting some school in, I wisely decided the best way to continue learning wasn't going to be in a classroom. I applied for a number of jobs and landed as a pastry grunt for a nice contemporary restaurant. It was here that I was inducted into the realities of the cooking industry. Most of my coworkers were addicted to something and would regularly get into fights in and out of work. I was a regular target for towel whippings, sabotage and blatant sexual harassment. But I kept my head down and worked as hard as I could, eventually earning the pleasure of watching the next newbie become the target of the group's frustration. After this, I become a short order cook for a local hotel. It was a similar group of folk here. The usual junkies, pill poppers and lunatics thrived here as well. But I was learning quickly. Already I had proven myself in both a savory and pastry kitchen. Something rare in the business. Around the end of my first year at the hotel, i decided to get serious. I enrolled in a Pastry school in San Francisco and moved there almost immediately. It was a 6 month program that basically consumed your life while you were there. I left the school classically trained in all subjects of the pastry world.<br>I had been working odd jobs while I was in school to make ends meet but I got my big break when Chef Stephen Issac at the Fairmont Hotel hired me as his baker. The kitchen was massive and the tools were bigger than i had ever seen. Chef Issac was my mentor and hero for years and I proudly learned everything I could from him while I was there. Once I left the Fairmont, I had a string of jobs but never really stayed in one place for too long. I was YouTube's first in-house pasrty chef when they were bought by Google and began their famously luxurious work style. I helped open a retaurant in Oakland, quickly making enemeies with the Chef there. By this pint, I was starting to become disillusioned by my surroundings. I broke up with my girlfriend, packed my bags and moved to Portland Oregon, attracted by the burgeoning food scene and more natural scenery. I started my Portland cooking journey working in a couple nice French places and slowly climbed back up the ladder to Pastry Chef again. Needing a shift in climate, I decided to go back into the savory kitchen and leave the pastry world behind. Through a number of jobs, I made my way up the heirarchy and worked as a Chef for a number of places. Some good, some bad.<br> At this point, I became a victim of not being able to learn from those around me. I had surpassed everyone in terms of skill and was looking forward to climbing anymore ladders. So I did the dumbest thing a person could do. I started a restaurant. It took me about 2 years to secure the funds to do it and I opened the doors on a rainy Halloween night. Though we swung for the fences and made every dollar count, it wasn't enough and I eventually pulled the plug. The education I recieved from the experience was priceless. It was a crash course in running a business. Something that I'm glad I understand better now. Post self employement, I bounced around a few jobs, never really finding the passion I once had for the industry. I slowly came to realize that I had drastically changed. I had transcended. I could cook on an incredibly high level, yet I never used a cookbook. I could make bread without a recipe. I knew every ratio, every shortcut, every technique, nothing mattered anymore. I could have done it in my sleep. The challenge was gone. Not to mention, I was getting too old for it. Once you get in your thirties, you're done. Or at least your knees are. Not wanting to be another casualty of the industry, I looked for another career. It hardly took any time to decide that I was going to dive into the tech field, particulary the web design and software path. I enrolled in school and armed with a fierce determination I studied my ass off until I was able to hold my own in a room full of geeks.<br>I'm incredibly grateful for the time I spent cooking professionally. Which was around 18 years total. It shaped the way that I see the world and opend me up to a plethora of cultures and all the cuisines that they bring with them. It introduced me to my wife and gave me the tenacity to oversome large adversity. Now, I get to reap the spoils of war, living in a great place in the Pacific Northwest with my loving wife and two dumb cats. Plus, I get to eat whatever I want!</p>

<h3 id="aboutSite">About this site:</h3>
<p>This site is intended to give instruction on how to cook for yourself in a realistic setting. Sure, we could go to a restaurant every night and have big cuts of meat with fancy sauces and all the bread sticks you can eat, but the reality is, thats not how most of us eat and it will get ludicrously expensive in a short time. Most of what i will be talking about is conceptual. Good cooks don't use cookbooks. We use ratios. For example, I don't need a recipe to make a vinaigrette. I just know that one part vinegar to three parts oil is a vinagrette. Change the oil, change the vinegar, doesn't matter. It's pretty much all the same and the detials just come down to your preference.<br>I have seen the dumbest people in my life in kitchens. I worked with people that couldn't read or write and they could cook proficiently. If you can read this, you're already ahead of the curve. There's a neverending wealth of information on every subject in cooking and you could go down a deep rabbit hole just learning about using the correct wood for smoking a duck breast.<br>My point is, you don't have to. I am going to explain how to approach these subjects from a more open mind to create simple dishes that you can recreate with little to no tools and be able to nourish yourself and your loved ones. If you get frustrated, try something else. Cooking isn't changing quickly and if you walk away from something, chances are, you'll get another shot at some point. Remember. This is my take on it. It's not the end of your road, but the beginning. If you find a better way, use it. Just try to keep all your fingers. Good luck and happy cooking!

<h3 id="thanks">Thanks</h3>
<p>Theres way too many people I can't think of for this but the three people that truly gave me the skills to doinate a kitchen are Rebecca Wendler, Chef Stephen Issac and everyone I stayed with on my trip to France. Thanks ya'll.</p>
