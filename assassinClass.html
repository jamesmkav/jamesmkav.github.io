                    <p class="card-text">As an assassin, you are a killer for hire. The other players can pay you to take out their opponents.. You are fast and dangerous when in close quarters. You are also the only character that can take the offensive against the police and counter them. Once you reach a higher level, you start recieving a bonus for each successful kill as well. Your only weakness will be your loner lifestyle.</p><br><br>

                         Young, angry and talented - <small class="text-muted"><strong>@LEVEL 2 =</strong> When you are within 3 spaces of any player, you may attempt a Hit on them. However, you can only attempt a Hit if another player pays you to. When a player is in qualifying distance and you are going to attempt a Hit, you announce to the other players you will do this and ask if anyone will pay the amount. A Hit costs another player whatever amount the current salary of the assassin is. This cost may also be split amongst any number of the other players but it is up to the Assassin to announce this opportunity. This action is performed before Mobility roll. This can be done multiple times, or as many players are within killing distance. NOTE - The Assasin may pay for a hit as well. However, they must pay twice their current salary.</small>
