      <h2>Before you Start</h2>
      <p>First decide how many pay periods(turns) the game is going to be. 25 is a good starting point and will result in a game around one to two hours, if players aren't distracted much. Each pay period, the player to the left of the player that last rolled takes their turn. All players start on the Start space. Now each player must pick a Character they will use for the game.</p>
      <h2>Characters</h2>
      <p>Each Character has a number of Promotions they can receive represented by tiers. Everyone starts at tier 1 and keeps record of Promotions they receive. As a player is promoted, they are awarded a higher Income and sometimes Strength Effects. Each player also has Weakness Effects that need to be considered before selection. The Characters all are meant to be played a little differently from one another and success will come easier if a player harnesses this in their long term strategy.*NOTE: IT IS THE INVIDIDUAL PLAYER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO EXERCISE THEIR CLASS'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. IT IS ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE ANOTHER PLAYER ISN'T Cheating..</p>
      <h2>Cheating</h2>
      <p>Everythings legal if you don't get caught.</p>
      <h2>The object of the game</h2>
      <p>After the number of pre-determined pay periods in game, The players total up their assets over the whole game. This is your life in a dollar value and what the players use to determine the winner. 
	  Just like real life</p>
      <h2>Who goes first?</h2>
      <p>The player with the most cash on hand. (coins included) If this makes anyone uncomfortable, roll a die to determine, you pussies.</p>
      <h2>How to use your turn</h2>
      <p>Each player starts with a single die and moves according to the number rolled combined with any Mobility they possess. For example, if a player has +2 Mobility, they will roll three dice for their movement.
	The player then follows the instructions on the space landed and any Effects their Character may possess.
	The player then records the total of all space Effects, Appreciation, Children, Marriage, and any Character specific Effects for that turn. Record even if negative.</p>
      <h2>Landing on a Space</h2>
      <p>Consequences both positive and negative that occur when landing on a space. Also, strengths and weaknesses specific to each Character. Can be triggered by achieving Promotions to higher tiers.</p>
      <h3>Asterisk spaces</h3>
      <p>When a player passes through or lands on a space with asterisks, they receive the Effects of that space.</p>
      <h3>STOP! spaces</h3>
      <p>When player is passing through or lands on a space with STOP!, they must remain on that space for remainder of turn. Player proceeds as normal for the next turn. Most STOP! Spaces also have Effects that proceed after landing.</p>
      <h2>Mobility</h2>
      <p>When a player lands on a Mobility space, they receive + 1 Mobility. Mobility is the number of extra dice a player may roll for movement. There are 3 possible Mobility tiers giving a maximum roll of 24(4 sixes), not including Character specific Effects.</p>
      <h2>Promotions</h2>
      <p>When a Character is promoted, they must fulfill the promotion's requirements. This is in the form of Education and sometimes a Life or Death Chance.</p>
      <h2>Life or Death Chance</h2>
      <p>Sometimes a promotion requires the player to make a Life or Death Chance. This is done by the player rolling 2 dice. If the total of both dice is 7 or higher, the Chance is successful. If the total is 6 or lower it is unsuccessful.
	If the Chance is Life, there is no punishment when unsuccessful and the player continues with the remainder of their turn.
	If the Chance is Death, when unsuccessful, the player goes back to the Start space and finishes their turn. They may not leave the Start space until they roll a 4 or higher during their next turn. The player's mobility counts toward this. The player, while deceased, receives their normal Income and Effects on their turn, even if roll is unsuccessful.</p>
      <h2>Jail</h2>
      <p>Sometimes a Character will get mixed up in some funny stuff and end up in Jail. When in Jail, you can pay the bailiff $1,000,000 for every year remaining on your sentence to be released early. Otherwise, player stays in Jail for remaining years in sentence.</p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>When a player obtains +1 Education, they go up one of the three tiers on their Scorecard and are able to receive Promotions that require that level of Education or lower.</p>
      <h2>Marriage</h2>
      <p>A player may get married, divorced, or remarried during their turn. There are 3  different tiers, each one having a higher KP bonus each turn. This is tracked on your Scorecard.</p>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>Players may have multiple children depending on the specific space's instructions, the way they roll, and Character Effects. For each child, there is a KP bonus each turn. This is tracked on your Scorecard. To try for a child/twins, player rolls 1 die for every 10 years remaining in the game. If the total is 6 or more, player is successful. If unsuccessful, no punishment and player finishes remainder of turn.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>1-10 years remaining=1 die</li>
          <li>11-20 years remaining=2 dice</li>
          <li>21-30 years remaining=3 dice</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Property</h2>
      <p>When a player lands on a Property space, they have the option of purchasing that specific Property. Use the number to reference what specific Property it is.
	If player decides to purchase the Property they pay the Asking Price and receive ownership of the Property.
	If they decide not to purchase the Property, it goes up for bidding between the remaining players. They player to the left of the original player starts the bidding by naming a price they would pay at least 500 dollars more than Asking Price.
	The next player to their left either names a higher price in a 500 dollar increment that they would pay or they drops out of the bidding. This continues until one player remains. They pay what they agreed to in the bidding and receive ownership of the property.
	The Appreciation and Rent for the Property purchased stay the same, regardless of the price paid for the Property.
*NOTE: IT IS THE PROPERTY OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THE PLAYER'S THAT PASS THIER PROPERTY PAY RENT. IF A PLAYER PASSES A PROPERTY AND FINISHES THEIR TURN OFFICIALLY BY THE NEXT PLAYER ROLLING THEIR DIE FOR MOVEMENT, NO RENT SHALL BE PAID.</p>
      <h2>The Bank Robbery</h2>
      <p>The player robbing the bank starts with 4 dice and rolls all of them. The total of all the dice is multiplied by $1,000,000. This is the reward for a successful robbery.
	The player then has 8 rolls to get all the dice to sixes. Once a six is rolled by any die, that die is taken away and the remaining dice are rolled until there are no more dice or the player fails to do this in 8 or less rolls.
	If successful, player receives the reward decided earlier and finishes remainder of turn, proceeding as normal.
	If unsuccessful, the player immediately goes to Jail for 4 years.</p>
      <h2>Gambling Rules</h2>
      <h3>Slots</h3>
      <p>Player rolls 4 dice. If the total of dice is 13 or more, player receives winnings on space.</p>
            <h3>Blackjack</h3>
            <p>Player rolls 4 dice. Player then selects two of the rolled dice to reroll. After the reroll, if the total of all 4 dice is between 18 and 20, player is successful. If the total of all 4 dice is 21, player receives a 50% bonus on their winnings.</p>
            <h3>Poker</h3>
            <p>Using the dice, player has 4 rolls to get one of the following.</p>

        <li>4 of a kind= 4 of the same of any number</li>
          <li>Straight=4 consecutive numbers</li>
      </ul>
